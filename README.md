# Master-Sword: Source Video Game

## Description

Master-Sword: Source is a mod created using the Source Engine by a small team including myself. Although the mod was never finished, a number of features were implemented including multiple enemies, a GUI based heads up display, melee weapons with advanced collision detection, and a character selection menu. The project was written entirely in C++. I was the team leader as well as a programmer. The project team consisted of programmers, level artists, musicians, character modeler designers, and an animate. The mod can be seen at its [moddb proflile](http://www.moddb.com/mods/master-sword-source). Unfortunately, all of the code was lost except for one image button class I posted on a developer wiki.
